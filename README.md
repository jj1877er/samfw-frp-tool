The **SamFw FRP Tool** is a software utility designed to help users bypass the **Factory Reset Protection (FRP)** lock on Samsung devices. FRP is a security feature on Android devices that prevents unauthorized access after a factory reset. If a device is reset without the owner's Google account credentials, FRP locks the device until the correct credentials are entered.
